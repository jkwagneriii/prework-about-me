      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Very stoked to be in the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp. Even with no coding background, I am already feeling more confident navigating through the computer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Dallas, Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are homebrewing kombucha with my sweet love Heather, cooking complicated plant-based recipes, running to heavy metal music, and creating improv and sketch comedy with my best friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would have to be running my own independent film company. I have no yearning to work on giant projects, but I do want to work towards being equipped to handle an entire production on my own. Sound, film, lighting, editing, marketing, all of it. I want to gain those skills and that knowledge so that I can create work with my friends and not have to rely on anybody but ourselves.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development seems to be the perfect combination of logic and art. It involves precision and creativity, which makes me feel motivated to learn something new. I see the job market growing everyday and want to be a part of the generation that sees code as an everyday language. With these new skills, I hope to find full-time employment and be able to use web development to enhance my other creative endevours. </p>
